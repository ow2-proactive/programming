	<para>
		Active objects have the ability to migrate between nodes while
		the application is running. Whatever application is used the active
		objects will continue running regardless of the migration of active
		objects.  
	</para>
    <para>The migration of an active object can be triggered by the active
    object itself, or by an external agent. In both cases, a single method
    will eventually get called to perform the migration. This method is
    <literal>migrateTo(...)</literal> which is accessible from a migratable body (a body
    that inherits from <literal>MigratableBody</literal>).</para>

    <para>In order to ease the use of the migration, ProActive provides 2 sets of
    static methods in the <literal>PAMobileAgent</literal> class. The first set is
    aimed at the migration triggered from the active object that wants to
    migrate. The methods rely on the fact that the calling thread 
    is the active thread of the active object:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><literal>PAMobileAgent.migrateTo(Object o)</literal>: migrate to the same
        location as an existing active object</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><literal>PAMobileAgent.migrateTo(String nodeURL)</literal>: migrate to the
        location given by the URL of the node</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><literal>PAMobileAgent.migrateTo(Node node)</literal>: migrate to the location
        of the given node</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The second set is aimed at the migration triggered from another
    agent than the target active object. In this case the external agent must
    have a reference to the Body of the active object it wants to
    migrate. The <literal>boolean</literal> value in the following methods
    indicates whether the migration modifies the computation of the application.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><literal>PAMobileAgent.migrateTo(Body body, Object o, boolean
        isNFRequest)</literal>: migrate to the same location as an existing
        active object</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><literal>PAMobileAgent.migrateTo(Body body, String nodeURL, boolean
        isNFRequest)</literal>: migrate to the location given by the URL of the
        node</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><literal>PAMobileAgent.migrateTo(Body body, Node node, boolean
        isNFRequest)</literal>: migrate to the location of the given node</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><literal>PAMobileAgent.migrateTo(Body body, Node node,  boolean isNFRequest,
                             int priority)</literal>: migrate to the location of the given node
          The <literal>int</literal> value indicates the priority of the non functional request.
          Levels are defined in the <literal>Request</literal> interface.</para>

    <para>Any active object has the ability to migrate. If it references some
    passive objects, they will also migrate to the new location. Since we rely
    on the serialization to send the object on the network, 
    <emphasis role="bold">the active object has to implement the <literal>Serializable</literal>
    interface</emphasis>. To migrate, an active object has to implement a method
    which contains a call to <literal> PAMobileAgent.migrateTo(...)</literal>. This call must be the
    last one in the method, i.e the method has to return immediately after. Here
    is an example of a method in an active object:</para>

    <programlisting language="java"><textobject><textdata fileref="automatic_snippets/method_moveTo.snip"/></textobject></programlisting>


    <para>We don't provide any test to check if the call to migrateTo is the
    last one in the method, hence if this rule is not enforced, it can lead to
    unexpected behavior. To make this object migrate, you just have to call
    its <literal>moveTo(String)</literal> method.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="Completeexample_77"><info><title>Complete example</title></info>
    
    <programlisting language="java"><textobject><textdata fileref="automatic_snippets/class_SimpleAgent.snip"/></textobject></programlisting>

    <para>The class SimpleAgent implements <literal>Serializable</literal> so
    the objects created will be able to migrate. We need to provide an empty
    constructor to avoid side effects during the creation of active objects.
    This object has two methods, <literal>moveTo()</literal> which makes it
    migrate to the specified location, and <literal>whereAreYou()</literal>
    which returns the hostname of the new location of the agent.</para>

    <programlisting language="java"><textobject><textdata fileref="automatic_snippets/migration_simple.snip"/></textobject></programlisting>

    <para>In the main method, we first need to create an active object, which
    is done through the call to <literal>newActive()</literal>. Once
    done, we load an application description in order to get a node. Then, we call its
    <literal>moveTo</literal> method which will make it migrate to the node
    specified as parameter and finally, we ask it what is its current
    location. For our application, we pass the location of the node as runtime
    parameter to the application. </para>

  <section xml:id="Dealingwithnonserializableattributes_77"><info><title>Dealing with non-serializable attributes</title></info>
    
      <para>The migration of an active object uses serialization.
      Unfortunately, not all the objects in the Java language are serializable so 
      the first step to solve the problem is to identify the unserializable 
      components.
      In front of the declaration of unserializable fields, we will put the keyword <literal>transient</literal>. This
      indicates that the value of this variable should not be serialized.
      After the first migration, these fields will be set to null since they have not been
      saved. So we have to explicitly rebuild them upon arrival of the active object at its
      new location. This can be done by using 
      the <literal>MigrationStrategyManager</literal> interface or 
      by implementing <literal>readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream in)</literal> and 
      <literal>writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream out)</literal>
      from the
      interface <literal>Serializable</literal>.
    </para>
    
    <section xml:id="UsingTheliteralMigrationStrategyManagerliteralInterface_77"><info><title>Using The <literal>MigrationStrategyManager</literal> Interface</title></info>
    	
    	<para>We can  use the methods <literal>onArrival(String) </literal>
    	and <literal>onDeparture(String) </literal> to specify which methods will
    	be run when the active objects migrates. </para>
    	<para>
    	The arguments for <literal>onArrival(String) </literal>
    	and <literal>onDeparture(String) </literal> are respectively the methods to be run before 
    	serialization and after deserialization. We instantiate a new <literal>
    	MigrationStrategyManagerImpl</literal> for the body of the object to 
    	be migrated and assign the methods to be run. For this, we use the 
    	<literal>initActivity(Body)</literal> method since we only need to run
    	the creation and assignment once.</para>
      
      <para>Here is the code of our <literal>UnSerializableAgent</literal> class:</para>

      <programlisting language="java"><textobject><textdata fileref="automatic_snippets/class_UnSerializableAgent.snip"/></textobject></programlisting>
    
      <para>This class is normally non-serializable since <literal>BigInteger</literal> is not serializable. If we tried to migrate the active object without implementing
      the <literal>initActivity()</literal> method as previously, we would get a <literal>NullPointerException</literal> when invoking a method on our
      <literal>toBeSaved</literal> variable.</para>

      <para>
         The following method is in charge of instantiate our object and to migrate it:

		    <para>Another way to deal with unserializable attributes is 
		    using the methods from the Serializable interface: </para>
          <programlisting language="java">
private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException;
private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
private void readObjectNoData() throws ObjectStreamException;</programlisting>
		    <para>
		    We override these methods to provide a way to save and restore the 
		    non-serializable components of the active object:

      <para>There are two ways to communicate with an active object which has
      migrated:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Forwarders</emphasis></para>

          <para>An active object, which is about to leave a site, leaves behind a special
          object called a forwarder which is in charge of forwarding incoming
          messages to the next destination. As time goes, a chain of
          forwarders is built between a caller and the mobile object. Any
          message sent to the latter will go through this chain to reach the
          agent. There is a virtual path between a caller and a mobile
          object. As soon as a call is performed on the agent, the chain of forwarders 
          is shortened into a direct link to the agent called. </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Location Server</emphasis></para>

          <para>Communicating with a mobile object can be done with an
          explicit reference towards the mobile entity, which requires the means
          to get its current location when necessary.</para>

          <para>There is a two-step communication: first there
          should be a search to obtain an up-to-date reference (localization),
          and then the actual communication. The simplest solution is to have
          a unique location server which maintains a database of the known
          position of the agents. When an object wants to communicate with an
          object which has migrated, it queries the server which sends back a
          new reference. If this is a correct reference then the communication
          takes place, otherwise a new query is issued.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Both techniques have their drawbacks. Two problems arise when
      using a forwarding scheme, especially if the ambition is scalable mobile
      agents over WAN. First, the forwarders use resources on a site as long
      as they have not been garbage collected. Thus, if a chain exists between
      to objects, it will remains even if there is no new communications going
      by. Second, the longer the chain is, the more likely it will be cut
      because of a hardware or software failure. As a consequence, while
      forwarders are more efficient under some conditions, they do not appear
      to be scalable, nor reliable.</para>

      <para>On the other hand, the server is a single point of failure and a
      potential bottleneck. If a server is to help communicating with a higher
      number of mobile agents, then it might not be able to serve requests
      quickly enough. Furthermore, in case of a crash, it is not possible to
      communicate with mobile active objects until the server is back. It is possible
      to avoid most of these issues by having redundant servers with load
      balancing at the cost of increasing complexity.</para>

      <para>Based on these observations and taking into account the
      variability of the environment, we use a configurable communication
      protocol which offers the main benefits from both the forwarder and the
      server while avoiding their drawbacks. Configurable with discrete and
      continuous parameters, it can be tailored to the environment to offer
      both performance and reliability.</para>

      <section xml:id="ForwarderAndAgentParameters_77"><info><title>Forwarder And Agent Parameters</title></info>
      	
      	<para>Forwarders and agents have several parameters which control their behaviour:</para>
      	<itemizedlist>
      		<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">forwarder time to live in milliseconds</emphasis> -  
      			<literal>proactive.mixedlocation.ttl </literal> </para>
      			<para>
		      			Time limited forwarders remain alive only for
			        a limited period. When their lifetime is over, they can be
			        removed. First of all, this brings an important advantage: scalability
			        due to absence of the DGC and the systematic reclaim of forwarding
			        resources. However this increases the risks of
			        having the forwarding chain cut since a forwarder might expire during the
			        normal execution of the application. In such a
			        situation, we rely on a server which will be considered as an
			        alternative solution. This increases the overall reliability.</para>
			        <para>
			       Use -1 to indicate that the  forwarders have a unlimited lifetime.</para>
      			</listitem>
      		<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">forwarder updating status, boolean</emphasis> 
      				- <literal>proactive.mixedlocation.updatingForwarder</literal> </para> 
      				<para>
	      			It is possible to rely on the forwarders to maintain the location
			        of the agent by having them update the server. When they reach the end
			        of their lifetime, they can send to the server their outgoing
			        reference which could be the address of the agent or another forwarder.
			        The <literal>updatingForwarder</literal> parameter can be true or false. If true
			         it releases the agent from most of the updates.
			        In order to increase reliability, it is possible to have also the agent
			         update the server on a regular basis.</para>
      		</listitem>
      		<listitem><para> <emphasis role="bold">agent time to update in milliseconds</emphasis></para>
      			<para> 
      			Each mobile agent has a nominal Time To Update (TTU) after which
       			it will inform the localization server of its new location. 
       			The TTU is defined as the first occurrence of two potential events since the last update:

			      		<para>This parameter indicates the number of migrations before updating the
			            server. Use -1 to indicate that the agent never updates the server.</para>

      	</itemizedlist>
      	
      	        <para>If we consider that both the agent and the forwarders can send
        updates to the server, the server must be able to make the difference
        between messages from the forwarders and from the agent which are
        always the most up to date. Also, since we do not have any constraint
        on the Time To Live (TTL) of the forwarders, it could be that a
        forwarder at the beginning of a chain dies after on at the end. If
        this happens and we are not careful when dealing with the requests,
        the server could erase a more up to date reference with an old
        one.</para>
